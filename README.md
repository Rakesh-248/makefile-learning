# makefile-learning
This repo was created to document all my learnings on makefiles. It may help others also who are trying to understand makefiles.

## Approach
1. The approach used in this repo is to provide a historical context on why makefiles were introduced.
2. Go through all the features of makefile in the same order how it was introduced in history.
3. Understand what was the problem faced and what were the solutions proposed in makefiles.
4. The GNU documentation and other online documentations were too detailed and complex to understand. For most part I have relied on chat gpt for the learnings.
5. The learning consists of building simple programs my making use of makefiles.
6. The makefiles evolve from simple to complex as one progresses through different levels.
